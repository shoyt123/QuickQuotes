"“In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded.”",Terry Pratchett
“Nothing happens until something moves.”,Albert Einstein
"“I'll be looking for you, Will, every moment, every single moment. And when we do find each other again, we'll cling together so tight that nothing and no one'll ever tear us apart. Every atom of me and every atom of you... We'll live in birds and flowers and dragonflies and pine trees and in clouds and in those little specks of light you see floating in sunbeams... And when they use our atoms to make new lives, they wont' just be able to take one, they'll have to take two, one of you and one of me, we'll be joined so tight...”",Philip Pullman
“Our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometry...”,Thomas Jefferson
“Physics isn't the most important thing. Love is.”,Richard P. Feynman
“Photons have mass? I didn’t even know they were Catholic.”,Woody Allen
"“Not only is the Universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think.”",Werner Heisenberg
"“No, this trick won't work... How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love? ”",Albert Einstein
"“Sometimes I wonder if my heart is like a black hole--it's so dense that there's no room for light, but that doesn't mean it can't still suck me in.”",Jasmine Warga
"“The role played by time at the beginning of the universe is, I believe, the final key to removing the need for a Grand Designer, and revealing how the universe created itself. … Time itself must come to a stop. You can’t get to a time before the big bang, because there was no time before the big bang. We have finally found something that does not have a cause because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me this means there is no possibility of a creator because there is no time for a creator to have existed. Since time itself began at the moment of the Big Bang, it was an event that could not have been caused or created by anyone or anything. … So when people ask me if a god created the universe, I tell them the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang, so there is no time for God to make the universe in. It’s like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth. The Earth is a sphere. It does not have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise.”",Stephen W. Hawking
"“I once read in my physics book that the universe begs to be observed, that energy travels and transfers when people pay attention. Maybe that's what love really boils down to--having someone who cares enough to pay attention so that you're encouraged to travel and transfer, to make your potential energy spark into kinetic energy.”",Jasmine Warga
“Ronan didn't need physics. He could intimidate even a piece of plywood into doing what he wanted.”,Maggie Stiefvater
“What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourth year of graduate school... It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don't understand it. You see my physics students don't understand it... That is because I don't understand it. Nobody does.”,Richard P. Feynman
"“The only thing known to go faster than ordinary light is monarchy, according to the philosopher Ly Tin Wheedle. He reasoned like this: you can't have more than one king, and tradition demands that there is no gap between kings, so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to the heir",Terry Pratchett
"“It is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this century, the silliest is quantum theory. In fact, some say that the only thing that quantum theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably correct.”",Michio Kaku
"“Physics is really nothing more than a search for ultimate simplicity, but so far all we have is a kind of elegant messiness.”",Bill Bryson
"“You may not feel outstandingly robust, but if you are an average-sized adult you will contain within your modest frame no less than 7 X 10^18 joules of potential energy—enough to explode with the force of thirty very large hydrogen bombs, assuming you knew how to liberate it and really wished to make a point.”",Bill Bryson
“Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it.”,Niels Bohr
“He who thinks half-heartedly will not believe in God; but he who really thinks has to believe in God.”,Isaac Newton
"“The release of atomic power has changed everything except our way of thinking ... the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind. If only I had known, I should have become a watchmaker. (1945)”",Albert Einstein
“Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.”,Erwin Schrödinger
“How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.”,Niels Bohr
"“And a new philosophy emerged called quantum physics, which suggest that the individual’s function is to inform and be informed. You really exist only when you’re in a field sharing and exchanging information. You create the realities you inhabit.”",Timothy Leary
“I remember discussions with,Werner Heisenberg
"“The Universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.”",J.B.S. Haldane
"“He needs ""space"" and ""time,"" as if this were physics and not a human relationship.”",Kathryn Stockett
"“But, if we consider, as physicists now claim, that everything is energy—everything we see, everything we think, everything we do—then it is just possible that this same law of conservation of energy applies to questions of morality. A conservation of moral energy, a maintenance of equilibrium… a balance exists and must be preserved. If an action is taken that disrupts that balance, then an action similar in kind and degree is required to restore equilibrium.”",J.K. Franko
“Nonsense is that which does not fit into the prearranged patterns which we have superimposed on reality...Nonsense is nonsense only when we have not yet found that point of view from which it makes sense.”,Gary Zukav
"“What I have done is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to be determined by the laws of science. In that case, it would not be necessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began. This doesn't prove that there is no God, only that God is not necessary.”",Stephen W. Hawking
"“The first principle of value that we need to rediscover is this: that all reality hinges on moral foundations. In other words, that this is a moral universe, and that there are moral laws of the universe just as abiding as the physical laws. (from ""Rediscovering Lost Values"")”",Martin Luther King Jr.
"“Energy is liberated matter, matter is energy waiting to happen.”",Bill Bryson
“Energy is neither created nor destroyed. It just changes shape.”,Sheri Reynolds
“Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.”,Albert Einstein
“The death of God left the angels in a strange position.”,Donald Barthelme
“Quantum theory provides us with a striking illustration of the fact that we can fully understand a connection though we can only speak of it in images and parables.”,Werner Heisenberg
“I think that modern physics has definitely decided in favor of,Werner Heisenberg
"“There is a philosophy that says that if something is unobservable -- unobservable in principle -- it is not part of science. If there is no way to falsify or confirm a hypothesis, it belongs to the realm of metaphysical speculation, together with astrology and spiritualism. By that standard, most of the universe has no scientific reality -- it's just a figment of our imaginations.”",Leonard Susskind
“Physics depends on a universe infinitely centred on an equals sign.”,Mark Z. Danielewski
"“Mathematics is the cheapest science. Unlike physics or chemistry, it does not require any expensive equipment. All one needs for mathematics is a pencil and paper.”",Polya George
“Nature has a great simplicity and therefore a great beauty”,Richard Feynman
“[T]he atoms or elementary particles themselves are not real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts.”,Werner Heisenberg
"“We absolutely must leave room for doubt or there is no progress and there is no learning. There is no learning without having to pose a question. And a question requires doubt. People search for certainty. But there is no certainty. People are terrified — how can you live and not know? It is not odd at all. You only think you know, as a matter of fact. And most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really don't know what it is all about, or what the purpose of the world is, or know a great deal of other things. It is possible to live and not know.”",Richard P. Feynman
"“We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state and as the cause of the state that is to follow. An intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at a given instant, as well as the momentary positions of all things in the universe, would be able to comprehend in one single formula the motions of the largest bodies as well as the lightest atoms in the world, provided that its intellect were sufficiently powerful to subject all data to analysis; to it nothing would be uncertain, the future as well as the past would be present to its eyes. The perfection that the human mind has been able to give to astronomy affords but a feeble outline of such an intelligence.”",Pierre Simon de Laplace
“The laws of physics is the canvas God laid down on which to paint his masterpiece”,Dan Brown
"“Indubitably, Magick is one of the subtlest and most difficult of the sciences and arts. There is more opportunity for errors of comprehension, judgement and practice than in any other branch of physics.”",Aleister Crowley
"“The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill as ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious perversion of physics- as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules”",Douglas Adams
“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.”,John Archibald Wheeler
“Order is heaven's first law.”,Alexander Pope
"“‎In modern physics, there is no such thing as ""nothing."" Even in a perfect vacuum, pairs of virtual particles are constantly being created and destroyed. The existence of these particles is no mathematical fiction. Though they cannot be directly observed, the effects they create are quite real. The assumption that they exist leads to predictions that have been confirmed by experiment to a high degree of accuracy.”",Richard Morris
"“Time and space were, from Death's point of view, merely things that he'd heard described. When it came to Death, they ticked the box marked Not Applicable. It might help to think of the universe as a rubber sheet, or perhaps not.”",Terry Pratchett
"“The person who wishes to attain human perfection should study logic first, next mathematics, then physics, and, lastly, metaphysics.”",Maimonides
"“Time and space are finite in extent, but they don't have any boundary or edge. They would be like the surface of the earth, but with two more dimensions.”",Stephen W. Hawking
“God abhors a naked singularity.”,Stephen Hawking
"“This is why magic is worse even than quantum physics. Because, while both spit in the eye of common sense, I've never yet had a Higgs bosun turn up and try to have a conversation with me.”",Ben Aaronovitch
“One possibility is: God is nothing but the power of the universe to organize itself.”,Lee Smolin
"“The very nature of the quantum theory ... forces us to regard the space-time coordination and the claim of causality, the union of which characterizes the classical theories, as complementary but exclusive features of the description, symbolizing the idealization of observation and description, respectively.”",Niels Bohr
"“If you see an antimatter version of yourself running towards you, think twice before embracing.”",J. Richard Gott
"“If a book were written all in numbers, it would be true. It would be just. Nothing said in words ever came out quite even. Things in words got twisted and ran together, instead of staying straight and fitting together. But underneath the words, at the center, like the center of the Square, it all came out even. Everything could change, yet nothing would be lost. If you saw the numbers you could see that, the balance, the pattern. You saw the foundations of the world. And they were solid.”",Ursula K. Le Guin
"“Physicists have come to realize that mathematics, when used with sufficient care, is a proven pathway to truth.”",Brian Greene
"“Each of us is aware he's a material being, subject to the laws of physiology and physics, and that the strength of all our emotions combined cannot counteract those laws. It can only hate them. The eternal belief of lovers and poets in the power of love which is more enduring that death, the finis vitae sed non amoris that has pursued us through the centuries is a lie. But this lie is not ridiculous, it's simply futile. To be a clock on the other hand, measuring the passage of time, one that is smashed and rebuilt over and again, one in whose mechanism despair and love are set in motion by the watchmaker along with the first movements of the cogs. To know one is a repeater of suffering felt ever more deeply as it becomes increasingly comical through a multiple repetitions. To replay human existence - fine. But to replay it in the way a drunk replays a corny tune pushing coins over and over into the jukebox?”",Stanisław Lem
"“Some string theorists prefer to believe that string theory is too arcane to be understood by human beings, rather than consider the possibility that it might just be wrong.”",Lee Smolin
"“Physicists like to think that all you have to do is say, these are the conditions, now what happens next?”",Richard P. Feynman
“Assessing existence while failing to embrace the insights of modern physics would be like wrestling in the dark with an unknown opponent.”,Brian Greene
“...quantum mechanics—the physics of our world—requires that you hold such pedestrian complaints in abeyance.”,Brian Greene
“A relativist is an individual who doesn't know the difference between an adjective and an adverb.”,Bill Gaede
"“Define the word exist, and you'll know whether God exists.”",Bill Gaede
"“Among all the occurrences possible in the universe the a priori probability of any particular one of them verges upon zero. Yet the universe exists; particular events must take place in it, the probability of which (before the event) was infinitesimal. At the present time we have no legitimate grounds for either asserting or denying that life got off to but a single start on earth, and that, as a consequence, before it appeared its chances of occurring were next to nil. ... Destiny is written concurrently with the event, not prior to it... The universe was not pregnant with life nor the biosphere with man. Our number came up in the Monte Carlo game. Is it surprising that, like the person who has just made a million at the casino, we should feel strange and a little unreal?”",Jacques Monod
"“Whether we like it or not, modern ways are going to alter and in part destroy traditional customs and values.”",Werner Heisenberg
“What's the matter? What's the antimatter? Does it antimatter?”,Wes Nisker
"“...rather than ask why something happened (i.e. what caused it), Jung asked: What did it happen for? This same tendency appears in physics: Many modern physicists are now looking more for ""connections"" in nature than for causal laws (determinism).”",M.-L. von Franz
"“The myth of quantum consciousness sits well with many whose egos have made it impossible for them to accept the insignificant place science perceives for humanity, as modern instruments probe the farthest reaches of space and time. ... quantum consciousness has about as much substance as the aether from which it is composed. Early in this century, quantum mechanics and Einstein’s relativity destroyed the notion of a holistic universe that had seemed within the realm of possibility in the century just past. First, Einstein did away with the aether, shattering the doctrine that we all move about inside a universal, cosmic fluid whose excitations connect us simultaneously to one another and to the rest of the universe. Second, Einstein and other physicists proved that matter and light were composed of particles, wiping away the notion of universal continuity. Atomic theory and quantum mechanics demonstrated that everything, even space and time, exists in discrete bits – quanta. To turn this around and say that twentieth century physics initiated some new holistic view of the universe is a complete misrepresentation of what actually took place. ... The myth of quantum consciousness should take its place along with gods, unicorns, and dragons as yet another product of the fantasies of people unwilling to accept what science, reason, and their own eyes tell them about the world.”",Victor J. Stenger
"“After long reflection in solitude and meditation, I suddenly had the idea, during the year 1923, that the discovery made by",Louis de Broglie
"“There are other reasons we use math in physics. Besides keeping us honest, math is also the most economical and unambiguous terminology that we know of. Language is malleable; it depends on context and interpretation. But math doesn’t care about culture or history. If a thousand people read a book, they read a thousand different books. But if a thousand people read an equation, they read the same equation.”",Sabine Hossenfelder
"“Credentials are like potential energy, the compliments of a name on paper, in documents, word of mouth, but faith is like kinetic energy, the motion and the force that which is witnessed. Hence in the end it is the faith rather than the credentials that really takes you places.”",Criss Jami
"“Many scientists have tried to make determinism and complementarity the basis of conclusions that seem to me weak and dangerous; for instance, they have used",Louis de Broglie
"“For the most part, physicists and mathematicians have settled on a fine division of labour in which the former complain about the finickiness of the latter, and the latter complain about the sloppiness of the former.”",Sabine Hossenfelder
