"“Heaven goes by favor. If it went by merit, you would stay out and your dog would go in.”",Mark Twain
"“If you want to test cosmetics, why do it on some poor animal who hasn't done anything? They should use prisoners who have been convicted of murder or rape instead. So, rather than seeing if perfume irritates a bunny rabbit's eyes, they should throw it in Charles Manson's eyes and ask him if it hurts.”",Ellen DeGeneres
“The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.”,Arthur Schopenhauer
"“A man can live and be healthy without killing animals for food; therefore, if he eats meat, he participates in taking animal life merely for the sake of his appetite. And to act so is immoral.”",Leo Tolstoy
“You can judge a man's true character by the way he treats his fellow animals.”,Paul McCartney
"“Until one has loved an animal, a part of one's soul remains unawakened.”",Anatole France
“The dog is a gentleman; I hope to go to his heaven not man's.”,Mark Twain

"“If slaughterhouses had glass walls, the whole world would be vegetarian.”",Linda McCartney
"“Perhaps in the back of our minds we already understand, without all the science I've discussed, that something terribly wrong is happening. Our sustenance now comes from misery. We know that if someone offers to show us a film on how our meat is produced, it will be a horror film. We perhaps know more than we care to admit, keeping it down in the dark places of our memory-- disavowed. When we eat factory-farmed meat we live, literally, on tortured flesh. Increasingly, that tortured flesh is becoming our own.”",Jonathan Safran Foer
"“The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.”",Willie Nelson
"“Dogs do not have many advantages over people, but one of them is extremely important: euthanasia is not forbidden by law in their case; animals have the right to a merciful death.”",Milan Kundera

“I have studied many philosophers and many cats. The wisdom of cats is infinitely superior.”,Hippolyte A. Taine
"“I made the choice to be vegan because I will not eat (or wear, or use) anything that could have an emotional response to its death or captivity. I can well imagine what that must feel like for our non-human friends - the fear, the terror, the pain - and I will not cause such suffering to a fellow living being.”",Rai Aren
"“How it is that animals understand things I do not know, but it is certain that they do understand. Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the world understands it. Perhaps there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak, without even making a sound, to another soul.”",Frances Hodgson Burnett
“Lots of people talk to animals...Not very many listen though...that's the problem.”,A.A. Milne
“Never call anyone a baboon unless you are sure of your facts.”,Will Cuppy
“An animal's eyes have the power to speak a great language.”,Martin Buber
"“True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power. Mankind's true moral test, its fundamental test (which is deeply buried from view), consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals.”",Milan Kundera
"“The dog’s agenda is simple, fathomable, overt: I want. “I want to go out, come in, eat something, lie here, play with that, kiss you. There are no ulterior motives with a dog, no mind games, no second-guessing, no complicated negotiations or bargains, and no guilt trips or grudges if a request is denied.”",Caroline Knapp
"“Holding this soft, small living creature in my lap this way, though, and seeing how it slept with complete trust in me, I felt a warm rush in my chest. I put my hand on the cat's chest and felt his heart beating. The pulse was faint and fast, but his heart, like mine, was ticking off the time allotted to his small body with all the restless earnestness of my own.”",Haruki Murakami
“To be able to laugh and to be merciful are the only things that make man better than the beast”,Ruskin Bond

“We all know interspecies romance is weird.”,Tim Burton
“animals never worry about Heaven or Hell. neither do I. maybe that's why we get along”,Charles Bukowski
"“We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. Remote from universal nature and living by complicated artifice, man in civilization surveys the creature through the glass of his knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion. We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate for having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein do we err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours, they move finished and complete, gifted with the extension of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings: they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth.”",Henry Beston
"“We must fight against the spirit of unconscious cruelty with which we treat the animals. Animals suffer as much as we do. True humanity does not allow us to impose such sufferings on them. It is our duty to make the whole world recognize it. Until we extend our circle of compassion to all living things, humanity will not find peace.”",Albert Schweitzer
“Never break a promise to an animal. They're like babies—they won't understand.”,Tamora Pierce
"“Animals are such agreeable friends―they ask no questions, they pass no criticisms.”",George Eliot

"“If you have men who will exclude any of God's creatures from the shelter of compassion and pity, you will have men who will deal likewise with their fellow men.”",Francis Of Assisi
“I can't abide people who go soft over animals and then cheat every human they come across!”,Diana Wynne Jones
"“Man, do not pride yourself on your superiority to the animals, for they are without sin, while you, with all your greatness, you defile the earth wherever you appear and leave an ignoble trail behind you -- and that is true, alas, for almost every one of us!”",Fyodor Dostoyevsky
“Whoever said you can't buy Happiness forgot little puppies.”,Gene Hill
"“Animals don’t lie. Animals don’t criticize. If animals have moody days, they handle them better than humans do.”",Betty White
"“I do not particularly like the word 'work.' Human beings are the only animals who have to work, and I think that is the most ridiculous thing in the world. Other animals make their livings by living, but people work like crazy, thinking that they have to in order to stay alive. The bigger the job, the greater the challenge, the more wonderful they think it is. It would be good to give up that way of thinking and live an easy, comfortable life with plenty of free time. I think that the way animals live in the tropics, stepping outside in the morning and evening to see if there is something to eat, and taking a long nap in the afternoon, must be a wonderful life. For human beings, a life of such simplicity would be possible if one worked to produce directly his daily necessities. In such a life, work is not work as people generally think of it, but simply doing what needs to be done.”",Masanobu Fukuoka
"“To be a vegetarian is to disagree - to disagree with the course of things today... starvation, cruelty - we must make a statement against these things. Vegetarianism is my statement. And I think it's a strong one.”",Isaac Bashevis Singer
“Veganism is not about giving anything up or losing anything; it is about gaining the peace within yourself that comes from embracing nonviolence and refusing to participate in the exploitation of the vulnerable”,GaryLFrancione
"“Humanity's true moral test, its fundamental test…consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals.”",Milan Kundera

“The problem with cats is that they get the same exact look whether they see a moth or an ax-murderer.”,Paula Poundstone
"“And the fox said to the little prince: men have forgotten this truth, but you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.”",Antoine de Saint-Exupery
"“Animals are reliable, many full of love, true in their affections, predictable in their actions, grateful and loyal. Difficult standards for people to live up to.”",Alfred A. Montapert
“May all that have life be delivered from suffering”,Buddha
"“We do not need to eat animals, wear animals, or use animals for entertainment purposes, and our only defense of these uses is our pleasure, amusement, and convenience.”",Gary L. Francione
"“I think using animals for food is an ethical thing to do, but we've got to do it right. We've got to give those animals a decent life and we've got to give them a painless death. We owe the animal respect.”",Temple Grandin
"“Ethical veganism results in a profound revolution within the individual; a complete rejection of the paradigm of oppression and violence that she has been taught from childhood to accept as the natural order. It changes her life and the lives of those with whom she shares this vision of nonviolence. Ethical veganism is anything but passive; on the contrary, it is the active refusal to cooperate with injustice”",GaryLFrancione
"“They're animals, all right. But why are you so goddam sure that makes us human beings?”",Stephen King
"“Animals are more than ever a test of our character, of mankind's capacity for empathy and for decent, honorable conduct and faithful stewardship. We are called to treat them with kindness, not because they have rights or power or some claim to equality, but in a sense because they don't; because they all stand unequal and powerless before us.”",Matthew Scully
"“There is no religion without love, and people may talk as much as they like about their religion, but if it does not teach them to be good and kind to man and beast, it is all a sham - all a sham, James, and it won't stand when things come to be turned inside out and put down for what they”",Anna Sewell
"“People leave imprints on our lives, shaping who we become in much the same way that a symbol is pressed into the page of a book to tell you who it comes from. Dogs, however, leave paw prints on our lives and our souls, which are as unique as fingerprints in every way.”",Ashly Lorenzana
“Horses make a landscape look beautiful.”,Alice Walker
"“Never mind, said Hachiko each day. Here I wait, for my friend who’s late. I will stay, just to walk beside you for one more day.”",Jess C. Scott
"“Not responding is a response--we are equally responsible for what we don't do. In the case of animal slaughter, to throw your hands in the air is to wrap your fingers around a knife handle.”",Jonathan Safran Foer
“Do you know why most survivors of the Holocaust are vegan? It's because they know what it's like to be treated like an animal.”,Chuck Palahniuk
"“I love things made out of animals. It's just so funny to think of someone saying, ""I need a letter opener. I guess I'll have to kill a deer.”",David Sedaris
"“Do you eat chicken because you are familiar with the scientific literature on them and have decided that their suffering doesn't matter, or do you do it because it tastes good?”",Jonathan Safran Foer
"“There are some dogs which, when you meet them, remind you that, despite thousands of years of man-made evolution, every dog is still only two meals away from being a wolf. These dogs advance deliberately, purposefully, the wilderness made flesh, their teeth yellow, their breath a-stink, while in the distance their owners witter, ""He's an old soppy really, just poke him if he's a nuisance,"" and in the green of their eyes the red campfires of the Pleistocene gleam and flicker.”",Neil Gaiman
"“Besides love and sympathy, animals exhibit other qualities connected with the social instincts which in us would be called moral.”",Charles Darwin
"“Needless to say, jamming deformed, drugged, overstressed birds together in a filthy, waste-coated room is not very healthy. Beyond deformities, eye damage, blindness, bacterial infections of bones, slipped vertebrae, paralysis, internal bleeding, anemia, slipped tendons, twisted lower legs and necks, respiratory diseases, and weakened immune systems are frequent and long-standing problems on factory farms.”",Jonathan Safran Foer
"“When you start with a necessary evil, and then over time the necessity passes away, what's left?”",Matthew Scully
"“Veganism is not a ""sacrifice."" It is a joy.”",GaryLFrancione
“The time will come when men such as I will look upon the murder of animals as they now look on the murder of men.”,Dimitri Merejkowski
"“Don't you find it a beautiful clean thought, a world empty of people, just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up?”",D.H. Lawrence
“The only good cage is an empty cage.”,Lawrence Anthony
"“If God had wanted us to be concerned for the plight of the toads, he would have made them cute and furry. ”",Dave Barry
“People who really appreciated animals always asked their names.”,Lilian Jackson Braun
“We have to speak up on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves.”,Peter Singer
"“People are like animals. Some are happiest penned in, some need to roam free. You go to recognize what's in her nature and accept it.”",Jeannette Walls
"“When animals express their feelings they pour out like water from a spout. Animals' emotions are raw, unfiltered, and uncontrolled. Their joy is the purest and most contagious of joys and their grief the deepest and most devastating. Their passions bring us to our knees in delight and sorrow.”",Marc Bekoff
“You don’t have to choose between being scientific and being compassionate.”,Robert M. Sapolsky
"“May our daily choices be a reflection of our deepest values, and may we use our voices to speak for those who need us most, those who have no voice, those who have no choice.”",Colleen Patrick-Goudreau
"“We may sometimes witness conversations at cross purposes and see how people hold muted dialogues of the deaf. They keep talking without really recognizing what the other is trying to bring home. Why should we not more engage in discussions with animals, promising much better results? Animals often appear to be much wiser, reasonable observers, and excellent listeners. (Let us say more and speak less)-Erik Pevernagie”",Erik Pevernagie
“To identify with others is to see something of yourself in them and to see something of them in yourself--even if the only thing you identify with is the desire to be free from suffering.”,Melanie Joy
“Hope was an instinct only the reasoning human mind could kill. An animal never knew despair.”,Graham Greene
"“I think he just loved being with the bears because they didn't make him feel bad. I get it too. When he was with the bears, they didn't care that he was kind of weird, or that he'd gotten into trouble for drinking too much and using drugs(which apparently he did a lot of). They didn't ask him a bunch of stupid questions about how he felt, or why he did what he did. They just let him be who he was.”",Michael Thomas Ford
“The fate of animals is of far greater importance to me than the fear of appearing ridiculous.”,Emile Zola
"“To see ten thousand animals untamed and not branded with the symbols of human commerce is like scaling an unconquered mountain for the first time, or like finding a forest without roads or footpaths, or the blemish of an axe. You know then what you had always been told -- that the world once lived and grew without adding machines and newsprint and brick-walled streets and the tyranny of clocks.”",Beryl Markham
"“Whether we change our lives or do nothing, we have responded. To do nothing is to do something.”",Jonathan Safran Foer
"“Humans — who enslave, castrate, experiment on, and fillet other animals — have had an understandable penchant for pretending animals do not feel pain. A sharp distinction between humans and 'animals' is essential if we are to bend them to our will, make them work for us, wear them, eat them — without any disquieting tinges of guilt or regret. It is unseemly of us, who often behave so unfeelingly toward other animals, to contend that only humans can suffer. The behavior of other animals renders such pretensions specious. They are just too much like us.”",Carl Sagan
"“I don't believe in the concept of hell, but if I did I would think of it as filled with people who were cruel to animals.”",Gary Larson
"“If ever you feel like an animal among men, be a lion.”",Criss Jami

“...only someone who'd never been an animal would put up a sign saying not to feed them....”,Jonathan Safran Foer
“My favorite animal is steak.”,Fran Lebowitz
"“Humans are the only animals that have children on purpose, keep in touch (or don't), care about birthdays, waste and lose time, brush their teeth, feel nostalgia, scrub stains, have religions and political parties and laws, wear keepsakes, apologize years after an offense, whisper, fear themselves, interpret dreams, hide their genitalia, shave, bury time capsules, and can choose not to eat something for reasons of conscience. The justifications for eating animals and for not eating them are often identical: we are not them.”",Jonathan Safran Foer
"“A dog teaches a boy fidelity, perseverance, and to turn around three times before lying down.”",Robert Benchley
“It's just the way things are. Take a moment to consider this statement. Really think about it. We send one species to the butcher and give our love and kindness to another apparently for no reason other than because,Melanie Joy
"“Were the walls of our meat industry to become transparent, literally or even figuratively, we would not long continue to raise, kill, and eat animals the way we do.”",Michael Pollan
"“Animals don't know as much about jealousy as people, but they're not ignorant of it, either.”",Stephen King
"“I believe that the best way to create good living conditions for any animal, whether it's a captive animal living in a zoo, a farm animal or a pet, is to base animal welfare programs on the core emotion systems in the brain. My theory is that the environment animals live in should activate their positive emotions as much as possible, and not activate their negative emotions any more than necessary. If we get the animal's emotions rights, we will have fewer problem behaviors... All animals and people have the same core emotion systems in the brain.”",Temple Grandin
"“Intelligence is more important than strength, that is why earth is ruled by men and not by animals.”",Amit Kalantri
“Killing animals to make a fashion statement = a sickening + cold-blooded vanity.”,Jess C. Scott
"“Kinship with all creatures of the earth, sky, and water was a real and active principle. In the animal and bird world there existed a brotherly feeling that kept us safe among them... The animals had rights - the right of man's protection, the right to live, the right to multiply, the right to freedom, and the right to man's indebtedness. This concept of life and its relations filled us with the joy and mystery of living; it gave us reverence for all life; it made a place for all things in the scheme of existence with equal importance to all.”",Chief Luther Standing Bear
"“Let us remember that animals are not mere resources for human consumption. They are splendid beings in their own right, who have evolved alongside us as co-inheritors of all the beauty and abundance of life on this planet”",Marc Bekoff
"“We should always be clear that animal exploitation is wrong because it involves speciesism. And speciesism is wrong because, like racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-semitism, classism, and all other forms of human discrimination, speciesism involves violence inflicted on members of the moral community where that infliction of violence cannot be morally justified. But that means that those of us who oppose speciesism necessarily oppose discrimination against humans. It makes no sense to say that speciesism is wrong because it is like racism (or any other form of discrimination) but that we do not have a position about racism. We do. We should be opposed to it and we should always be clear about that.”",GaryLFrancione
"“As for hearing, the sloth is not so much deaf as uninterested in sound.”",Yann Martel
"“Only those few who are able to surpass their fear of death completely can fully experience the highest forms of life; not the mundane life of the mortal, but the godly life of the resurrected.”",Zeena Schreck
“..the most dangerous animal in a zoo is Man.”,Yann Martel
“Anybody who hates dogs and babies can't be all bad.”,Leo Rosten
“We can no more justify using nonhumans as human resources than we can justify human slavery. Animal use and slavery have at least one important point in common: both institutions treat sentient beings exclusively as resources of others. That cannot be justified with respect to humans; it cannot be justified with respect to nonhumans—however “humanely” we treat them.”,Gary L. Francione
"“They are all beasts of burden in a sense, ' Thoreau once remarked of animals, 'made to carry some portion of our thoughts.' Animals are the old language of the imagination; one of the ten thousand tragedies of their disappearance would be a silencing of this speech.”",Rebecca Solnit
"“More often than not, what animals require our protection from is not hurricanes or fires, but abuse at the hands of other people"".”",Julie Klam
“Platypus? I thought it was pronounced platymapus. Has it always been pronounced platypus?”,Jessica Simpson
“He could tell by the way animals walked that they were keeping time to some kind of music. Maybe it was the song in their own hearts that they walked to.”,Laura Adams Armer
"“But why must the system go to such lengths to block our empathy? Why all the psychological acrobatics? The answer is simple: because we care about animals, and we don't want them to suffer. And because we eat them. Our values and behaviors are incongruent, and this incongruence causes us a certain degree of moral discomfort. In order to alleviate this discomfort, we have three choices: we can change our values to match our behaviors, we can change our behaviors to match our values, or we can change our",Melanie Joy
