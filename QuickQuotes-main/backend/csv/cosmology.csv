"“For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.”",Carl Sagan
"“Recognize that the very molecules that make up your body, the atoms that construct the molecules, are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centers of high mass stars that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy, enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of life. So that we are all connected to each other biologically, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically. That’s kinda cool! That makes me smile and I actually feel quite large at the end of that. It’s not that we are better than the universe, we are part of the universe. We are in the universe and the universe is in us.”",Neil deGrasse Tyson
“Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.”,Douglas Adams
"“I... a universe of atoms, an atom in the universe.”",Richard P. Feynman
"“How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.”",Carl Sagan
"“The role played by time at the beginning of the universe is, I believe, the final key to removing the need for a Grand Designer, and revealing how the universe created itself. … Time itself must come to a stop. You can’t get to a time before the big bang, because there was no time before the big bang. We have finally found something that does not have a cause because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me this means there is no possibility of a creator because there is no time for a creator to have existed. Since time itself began at the moment of the Big Bang, it was an event that could not have been caused or created by anyone or anything. … So when people ask me if a god created the universe, I tell them the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang, so there is no time for God to make the universe in. It’s like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth. The Earth is a sphere. It does not have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise.”",Stephen W. Hawking
“I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars.”,Walt Whitman
“My view is that if your philosophy is not unsettled daily then you are blind to all the universe has to offer.”,Neil deGrasse Tyson
"“And when the universe has finished exploding all the stars will slow down, like a ball that has been thrown into the air, and they will come to a halt and they will all begin to fall towards the centre of the universe again. And then there will be nothing to stop us seeing all the stars in the world because they will all be moving towards us, gradually faster and faster, and we will know that the world is going to end soon because when we look up into the sky at night there will be no darkness, just the blazing light of billions and billions of stars, all falling.”",Mark Haddon
"“Philosophy [nature] is written in that great book which ever is before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. The book is written in mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.”",Galileo
"“And when you look at the sky you know you are looking at stars which are hundreds and thousands of light-years away from you. And some of the stars don’t even exist anymore because their light has taken so long to get to us that they are already dead, or they have exploded and collapsed into red dwarfs. And that makes you seem very small, and if you have difficult things in you life it is nice to think that they are what is called negligible, which means they are so small you don’t have to take them into account when you are calculating something.”",Mark Haddon
"“A blade of grass is a commonplace on Earth; it would be a miracle on Mars. Our descendants on Mars will know the value of a patch of green. And if a blade of grass is priceless, what is the value of a human being?”",Carl Sagan
"“Sometimes I think we're alone in the universe, and sometimes I think we're not. In either case, the idea is quite staggering.”",Arthur C. Clarke
"“We live on a hunk of rock and metal that circles a humdrum star that is one of 400 billion other stars that make up the Milky Way Galaxy which is one of billions of other galaxies which make up a universe which may be one of a very large number, perhaps an infinite number, of other universes. That is a perspective on human life and our culture that is well worth pondering.”",Carl Sagan

“One possibility is: God is nothing but the power of the universe to organize itself.”,Lee Smolin
"“I would suggest that science is, at least in my part, informed worship.”",Carl Sagan
“The total amount of energy from outside the solar system ever received by all the radio telescopes on the planet Earth is less than the energy of a single snowflake striking the ground.”,Carl Sagan
"“It took less than an hour to make the atoms, a few hundred million years to make the stars and planets, but five billion years to make man!”",George Gamow
"“Some piously record 'In the beginning God', but I say 'In the beginning hydrogen'.”",Harlow Shapley
"“There's no obvious reason to assume that the very same rare properties that allow for our existence would also provide the best overall setting to make discoveries about the world around us. We don't think this is merely coincidental. It cries out for another explanation, an explanation that... points to purpose and intelligent design in the cosmos.”",Guillermo Gonzalez
"“It’s hard to build models of inflation that don't lead to a multiverse. It’s not impossible, so I think there’s still certainly research that needs to be done. But most models of inflation do lead to a multiverse, and evidence for inflation will be pushing us in the direction of taking [the idea of a] multiverse seriously.”",Alan H. Guth
“All what we think and know is an illusion. Nothing exists. Everything is an opinion.”,Ash Vaz
“The sun symbolizes the Divine intelligence; the empty vastness of space symbolizes the Divine All-Possibility and also the Divine immutability; a bird symbolizes the soul; a tree symbolizes the grades of being; and water symbolizes knowledge and rain revelation.”,Osman Bakar
"“How can we satisfy ourselves without going on in infinitum? And, after all, what satisfaction is there in that infinite progression? Let us remember the story of the Indian philosopher and his elephant. It was never more applicable than to the present subject. If the material world rests upon a similar ideal world, this ideal world must rest upon some other; and so on, without end. It were better, therefore, never to look beyond the present material world.”",David Hume
"“There cannot be a language more universal and more simple, more free from errors and obscurities...more worthy to express the invariable relations of all natural things [than mathematics]. [It interprets] all phenomena by the same language, as if to attest the unity and simplicity of the plan of the universe, and to make still more evident that unchangeable order which presides over all natural causes”",Joseph Fourier
"“It is possible that these millions of suns, along with thousands of millions more we cannot see, make up altogether but a globule of blood or lymph in the veins of an animal, of a minute insect, hatched in a world of whose vastness we can frame no conception, but which nevertheless would itself, in proportion to some other world, be no more than a speck of dust.”",Anatole France
“There are only certain intervals of time when life of any sort is possible in an expanding universe and we can practise astronomy only during that habitable time interval in cosmic history.”,John D. Barrow
“The unity of scientific and spiritual knowledge is realized when each of the particular sciences is organically related to the supreme knowledge of al-tawhid.”,Osman Bakar
"“We want union with something, even if the opposite seems true.  Bring two atomic nuclei together and their positive electrostatic forces will repel each other, but, with the patience and strength of the blind god of the galaxies, there comes a point where something bigger takes over and welds them together. Physicists call it the Strong Nuclear Force; I’ve called this magic glue God. All the elements heavier than hydrogen were so formed, forged in the great hearts of the stars: sulphur, potassium, gold, radium. Everything you can think of.  ”",Sean J. Halford
"“Anybody who has done high school physics knows Newton’s Third Law. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. You push against a wall; it pushes back against you. I love the poetry hidden in these truths, in the many laws we’ve discovered that underpin the universal fabric. We search for meaning ever hungrier, perhaps even with desperation: the symmetry in the equations freaks us out; for all we know, there is just us on this lonely little marble in the inky void.”",Sean J. Halford
“Time is the result of One not wanting to be alone.”,Wald Wassermann
“Time is the result of Self not wanting to be by itself.”,Wald Wassermann
“What is Gravity but Self not wanting to be by itself and what is the purpose of Self but Companionship otherwise known as Love.”,Wald Wassermann
“Spacetime does not emerge out of the interaction of particles. Rather. There is only oneself partnering with itself so not to be by itself.”,Wald Wassermann
“Complexity is the result of simplicity not wanting to be by itself.”,Wald Wassermann
“The sea creates waves so to be able to experience companionship itself. Knowing this. What is there thus to argue about? What is there thus to fight over? Nothing is more absurd than conflict. Conflict is born out of forgetfulness. Forgetfulness that all this is self and that the one and only purpose of self - the meaning of life - is companionship otherwise known as love.”,Wald Wassermann
"“When it comes to the anthropic principle both the weak anthropic principle (WAP) which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of selection bias (specifically survivorship bias) and the strong anthropic principle (SAP) which states that the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it are erroneous. Truth is simple. 'There is only one principal whose principal reason is companionship more commonly known as love.' That is to say; 'There is only intelligence or one consciousness which has conceived itself to perceive itself as self differentiated, as sapient life, so not to be by itself and this for the purpose of self companionship i.e. self love.' That may sound difficult to understand but what it means in most simple terms is that the meaning of life is simply love. I am not a fan of adding new formulations to the lexicon of physics but if we would have to do so I would call it the 'absolute anthropic principle (AAP)'.”",Wald Wassermann
“The purpose of relativity is companionship.”,Wald Wassermann
“Life is the result of Self not wanting to be by itself.”,Wald Wassermann
"“When the Universe attains Versistasis, everything will both cease to exist and be created in the perfected dual moment.”",Jason Jowett
“The assumption that evolution fails to address how everything came into existence is a fallacy. Truth is simple and self-evident. Evolution means love in action. What it means is that the origin of everything is self not wanting to be by itself and that the purpose of self and as such the meaning of life is companionship more commonly known as love. As such the definition of the theory of evolution i.e. evolutionary biology in simple terms.”,Wald Wassermann
“Life is the result of the unwillingness of Self to be by itself.”,Wald Wassermann
"“The Absolute Anthropic Principle (AAP) states that the origin of everything (including but not limited to all life, the world and the universe) is Self not wanting to feel by itself and that the purpose of Self and as such the meaning of Life is Companionship more commonly known as Love.”",Wald Wassermann
"“Some of the science literature on entropy erroneously assumes that, as one goes forward in time, one moves from order to disorder. Naturally this is erroneous for the simple reason that there is no such thing as disorder; there is only complexity within simplicity.”",Wald Wassermann
"“The premise of the Absolute Anthropic Principle (AAP) is that the origin of everything including but not limited to all life, the world and the universe is Self not wanting to feel by itself and that the purpose of Self and as such the meaning of Life is nothing else but Companionship more commonly known as Love.”",Wald Wassermann
"“It is important to understand that most of us do not think about the world in the way we do because we have reasoned from first principles to a comprehensive understanding of the cosmos. Rather, we generally operate on the basis of intuitions that we have often unconsciously absorbed from the culture around us.”","Carl Trueman, The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self"
“There exists this wonderful romantic idea in cosmology that the initial singularity which caused the big bang is still singular but self differentiated so to be able to love- and be loved in return.”,Wald Wassermann
"“In biology and cosmology alike (for both are two sides of the same coin) it could and it should be said that life is self celebrating itself as differentiated so not to be by itself and with this realization, which is rather profound, comes the equally profound understanding that the purpose of self, or the meaning of life as we call it, is nothing else but companionship otherwise known as love. So if i were to talk to a theologist about allah, buddha or god; it would certainly not be incorrect to state the purpose of god is love, and, similarly so, if i were to talk to a cosmologist; it would certainly not be incorrect to state that the purpose of the cosmos is love.”",W. Wassermann
"“When it comes to the subject of whether or not we are alone in the universe it must be understood that we are the all one but, since it is not good to be alone, we, the one, is diverse.”",Wald Wassermann
"“What if this so-called elusive theory of everything is none other than self celebrating itself as self differentiated for the purpose of companionship, friendship and love?”",Wald Wassermann
“It is not good for Self to be by itself.”,Wald Wassermann
“Inflation is self-perceived differentiation.”,Wald Wassermann
“So then what about this dark energy and gravity business? Dark energy is self. Gravity is self. And self best forget about making a distinction between light and dark too for self shines forth all colors into that good night.”,Wald Wassermann
“The theory of everything is not elusive but all-inclusive.”,Wald Wassermann
“I≡LOVE”,Wald Wassermann
“Inflation is self perceived differentiation.”,Wald Wassermann
“What is the theory behind quantum physics but self not wanting to be by itself and what is the purpose of self but companionship otherwise known as love.”,Wald Wassermann
“I am not opposed to kindergarten-science; it is just that I am no longer in kindergarten and neither are you.”,Wald Wassermann
"“In order to understand why there is life it must first be understood what life really is and, although I am in agreement with the brilliant definition expressed by my colleague and friend Edward Nikolayevich Trifonov which simply states that 'life is self-reproduction with variations' it does not not give an answer to the 'why is there life to begin with?' question. As such I propose a more harmonic and all-inclusive scientific definition. Life is Self celebrating itself as Self-differentiated for Companionship otherwise known as Love.”",Wald Wassermann
"“Sometimes we have it backwards and I am not talking about the good type of of backwards à la kris kross. What I am talking about here is all these hypotheses in astrophysics, cosmology and theoretical physics which are then called 'theories' as in plural this although 'theory is always one' and 'one's purpose is always companionship otherwise known as friendship and love'.”",Wald Wassermann
“The big bang is a synonym for bio diversity and bio diversity is a synonym for self differentiation and the purpose of self differentiation is so self could experience companionship otherwise known as love hence the why of the gospel of love.”,Wald Wassermann
“If an astrophysicist tells you that 'the universe has no obligation to make sense to you' I suggest to walk slowly away for you are the universe.”,Wald Wassermann
"“Sometimes we in the sciences have it backwards and I am not talking about the good type of backwards à la kris kross. What I am talking about is all these hypotheses in astrophysics, cosmology and theoretical physics which we call 'theories' as in plural this although theory is always singular and this while the singular purpose is always companionship otherwise known as friendship and love.”",Wald Wassermann
“Do not allow yourself to be fooled by the erudite who proclaims that the universe has no rhyme or reason for the universe is self and the purpose of self is love.”,Wald Wassermann

“That which is revealed to man has been created for him only. That which he thinks he knoweth shall remain hidden until such a time that his eyes are open.”,Kayambila Mpulamasaka
"“Rural culture is marked by a different sense of time, a different cosmology. At the core of rural culture, he says, is a belief that the universe is already perfect as it is, and that our duty as humans is to maintain that harmony. This was a sentiment I heard often from farmers as I traveled throughout the countryside . One farmer told me that the future is a created concept, and that in the fields, in the long dark of winters, there is no future, because every day depends on tending to the present moment. An act of care. In contrast, urban culture is centered on the belief that the universe must be constantly corrected on its course, and that life is defined by the pleasure of overcoming future challenges.”",Xiaowei Wang
“So to be able to experience companionship oneself.”,Wald Wassermann
"“In fact, it could be said that our language evolved for the express purpose of allowing us to participate in that interaction with others. That would explain why it is so hard to talk about whatever it is that might lie beyond or behind the description of the world: our language evolved to represent the description, and not the world itself.”",Larry  Gottlieb
"“A strange mixture of disbelief and complete trust washed over me. On the one hand, I had no way to explain what had just happened, and on the other I was again feeling that everything was fine. In terms of what I see now, the world had stopped for me.”",Larry  Gottlieb
"“After more than a hundred years of debate, quantum scientists still believe that the physical world is a law-based machine… Perhaps the time will come when these women and men of science finally discover for themselves that we cannot fully explain reality without talking about consciousness. Maybe then, more of them will begin to consider the implications of realizing that there is no world apart from its observation, that the world “out there” isn’t what it seems to be, and that we are so much more than we imagine ourselves to be.”",Larry  Gottlieb
"“We depend on our description of the world for everything we perceive. As a result, nothing new can be allowed to threaten that description; we hold onto it with all our might. So, what happens when we encounter new events and new people, and we form new memories?”",Larry  Gottlieb
“Trying to change situations or conditions solely with action in the world would be like trying to fix an unwanted image in the mirror without changing what’s being reflected. It just doesn't work.”,Larry  Gottlieb

"“Life is self expressing itself as self-differentiated for the purpose of companionship, friendship, love.”",Wald Wassermann
"“For many thousands of years, human beings have wondered and asked questions about the distant past and the remote future of our world. The fact that we continue to ask such questions does not distinguish us from our ancient ancestors. What does make us different is that for the first time in history we, as a species, are capable of producing real and credible answers to these questions. We are among the first to be witness of the Big Bang.”",Dan Hooper

"“The human is not a fixed entity from the beginning but, along with the rest of creation, is in the process of becoming.”",Terence E. Fretheim
"“Sin and evil have their origins in the human will, not in God or in God's plan. At the same time, when sin and evil do enter into the life of the world, they do not become constitutive of what is means to be human (or any other creature).”",Terence E. Fretheim
"“Our most basic images of God will shape our lives, willy-nilly, including how we think about the larger environment in which we live.”",Terence E. Fretheim

“In theory all is turiya.”,Wald Wassermann
"“I wonder how it can be considered that science disenchants the world. The power of the spells of physics to make the empty solid — and nothing, something — seem greater than anything I have ever read in folk tales.”",Robin Ince
"“If physics and cosmology are truly sciences, then there exists a body of excellent evidence that the scale and the varieties of Being vastly exceed anything an earlier generation could have imagined. This persuades me that reasoning about ultimate things cannot be based on the anomalous fragment of reality accessible to our awareness.”",Marilynne Robinson
“Why the quantum but love.”,Wald Wassermann
"“The elusive theory of everything (ToE) is not as elusive as one leads itself to believe for ""everything is theory"" (EiT) and the purpose of theory is love.”",Wald Wassermann
“The goal of science is not to make things needlessly complex; the goal of science is to explain that the purpose of complexity* is love. (* diversity)”,Wald Wassermann
“What we have here is forgetfulness. Forgetfulness that the origin of self is self not wanting to be by itself and that the purpose of self (and thus the meaning of life) is simply companionship otherwise known as love. This forgetfulness is of course not all that unusual considering the fact that the age of the universe is 13.787±0.020 billion years. I mean... I cannot even remember what I did yesterday. As such the purpose of science. The purpose of science is to piece everything together in a simple theory of everything; a theory of everything that was never even elusive to begin with. It simply has always been about love right from the start.”,Wald Wassermann
"“The large scale structure of the universe we observe today was formed from small quantum fluctuations which have been amplified by gravity over 13.787±0.020 billion years. But why difficult when truth is simple? The origin of self is self not wanting to be by itself and the purpose of self is companionship otherwise known as love; so love, simply love.”",Wald Wassermann
"“The scientific evidence laid out before us leads to a simple and beautiful view of the origin of life. The chain of events that led to life commenced out of one's very own desire not to be alone, one's very own desire for companionship, one's very own desire for friendship, one's very own desire for love.”",Wald Wassermann

"“Coping with the uncertainty of larger cosmic objective meaning may be one of the most profound challenges sufficiently aware beings have to face [...]. Indeed, human beings might be further along in this regard than may be commonly thought—much of the human population seems to able to cope without religion and without a larger sense of cosmic meaning and purpose.”",Steven J. Dick
"“In addition to the uncertainty of broader cosmic significance, it may be that intelligent beings might have to learn to cope with a known cosmic insignificance, leading for some perhaps to a kind of nihilistic worldview. For others, something short of nihilism might suggest instead a kind of “cosmically local” relativism where value, meaning, purpose, ethics, and aesthetics derive solely from the affairs of cultural beings who think, behave, and perhaps freely choose in such ways as to sometimes, but often not, establish widely accepted norms and standards to help “local” beings coexist.”",Steven J. Dick
"“[I]f culture is seen to be a deep manifestation and expected outcome of cosmic evolution, this would engender worldviews in which we are seen to be at home in the universe, to belong to the universe, to be an important part of its fundamental nature. This is a friendly universe, a cosmos in which many will feel a deep sense of comfort and belonging and perhaps a larger sense of objective meaning and purpose—which in turn can have an impact on how intelligent beings think and act in the world and if/how intelligent beings may ultimately influence the evolution of the universe itself.”",Steven J. Dick
"“Mankind belongs to cosmic intelligence, Nothing is accidental. In the universe, different dimensions are connected to dynamic harmony.”",Brian O.
"“A lack of “external” objective meaning may be unsatisfying to many—caught forever in endless cycles of relativism, a morass of unbearable responsibility for our own meaning and purpose, and perhaps ultimately for that of the universe. But it looks like choice is inescapable. And while choice can sometimes be oppressive and debilitating, it is also liberating and empowering[.]”",Steven J. Dick
"“Seeing ourselves in a cosmic context that suggests our selfish biological evolution is not necessarily part of a deep cosmic design can help motivate us to take better control of our local and collective global behavior as a species. It can help sensitize us to some of the blinding adverse effects of cultural forces such as dogmatic ideologies that too often lead to unnecessary conflict. Seeing ourselves in a longer-term cosmic context can help us envision a healthier, more united human species, creating recognition of value for global engagement and collective global pursuits as opposed to pursuing strictly group or national interests. Seeing ourselves as a special fragile species that may be “on our own,” with potential cosmic significance, can indeed help us act as a global species—and the need to come together better as a species is evident on many fronts [.]”",Steven J. Dick
"“But there is also a less practical, and perhaps equally important, consequence of migrating off Earth—the creation of cultural diversity. Finding better ways to live is clearly important. But finding different ways to live is culturally enriching both to the human experience and perhaps to the “nonhuman” experience. New branches of cultural evolution can enhance the human condition and enrich our lives by giving us more to take note of, more to study, more to choose from, more to appreciate, more to take joy in, more to be inspired by, and more to be in awe of.”",Steven J. Dick
"“Whether one thinks life and culture arose by chance or are instead a part of cosmic design, an argument can be made either way for the value of life, intelligence, and culture. Whether we are a kind of rare cosmic gem, part of a “cosmic fugue,” or perhaps a part of cosmic destiny, there is arguably some form of noteworthy significance we can claim for life, mind, and culture. Either way, we can see ourselves as precious and meaningful, worth preserving, and worth developing to the greatest potential—for ourselves and the whole of the universe.”",Steven J. Dick
"“The origin of life is self not wanting to be by itself. The purpose of self companionship, friendship, love.”",Wald Wassermann
“The purpose of the universe is love.”,Wald Wassermann
"“The key shortcoming of the multiverse theory, however, is that it appeals to something outside the universe, namely, a vast ensemble of other universes and a set of meta-laws that exist for no reason (e.g., quantum mechanics, string theory). In this respect, the multiverse theory is little better than a direct theistic explanation where an appeal is made to an external creator/designer.”",Steven J. Dick
“There is no need to remove the grand designer out of the how-the-universe-began equation. It is simply not possible. You see. Both are self. The universe is self. The grand designer is self. Self has been one since time immemorial. In fact; it is oneself which has created itself to perceive itself as differentiated so not to be by itself. The cause - loneliness - matters not as much as the purpose - love. Love so love”,Wald Wassermann
"“Indeed, we humans bear witness to the process of evolution in the very composition of our bodies. The calcium that gives solidity to our bones, the iron that lets our blood carry oxygen to our brains, the sodium and potassium that make possible the transmission of impulses along our nerves, all of these elements were formed inside a star that had its own birth and life and death, hurling its remains outward in a supernova explosion billions of years ago.”",Steven J. Dick
"“Yes, we humans are more than merely biological creatures. We appreciate beauty, we struggle with ethical conflicts, and we strive to make sense of our purpose in the universe, asking questions that science cannot answer. And yet, our sense of aesthetics, our moral sensibilities, and our search for meaning may themselves be intricately connected to the fabric of the cosmos.”",Steven J. Dick
"“Without knowing the full extent of the past, we have no idea whether the events we can see are typical of larger patterns or simply contingent products of particular eras, societies, or conjunctures. A statistician might say that the sample from which historians generalize is seriously skewed for the simple reason that we have no idea how or by how much it is skewed! If that is true, it makes all the larger generalizations of historians suspect.”",Steven J. Dick
“Emergent properties can seem magical because they do not seem to arise from the component parts of a structure. [...] Thought [...] seems to be an emergent property of the organization of neurons in brains. [...] “Emergent properties” arise from a particular arrangement of components—they do not appear within the component parts themselves.”,Steven J. Dick
"“All living species “adapt.” Indeed, “adaptation” is a distinctive emergent property of life in general. Adaptation means that, over time, the average features of a species can slowly change so as to ensure that each individual member can extract from its surroundings the energy needed to maintain its complex structures. This is what natural selection is all about. But it’s a slow process, taking many generations. Individuals don’t adapt; what adapt or change are the average qualities of entire species, as the genes of individuals undergo tiny changes from generation to generation.”",Steven J. Dick
"“It is correct to note that the initial stage of cosmic inflation was incredibly smooth and orderly pointing to an initial state of zero or near-zero entropy. It is even more correct to note that self moved itself so not to be by itself and this for the purpose so self could experience companionship, friendship, love. Hence why zero became zorro. Meaning? Self masks as in veils itself so not to be by itself with the purpose of self being love. Very true. Truly simple. The purpose of self is love.”",Wald Wassermann
