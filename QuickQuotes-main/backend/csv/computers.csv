"“Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”",Rob Siltanen
"“I still love books. Nothing a computer can do can compare to a book. You can't really put a book on the Internet. Three companies have offered to put books by me on the Net, and I said, 'If you can make something that has a nice jacket, nice paper with that nice smell, then we'll talk.' All the computer can give you is a manuscript. People don't want to read manuscripts. They want to read books. Books smell good. They look good. You can press it to your bosom. You can carry it in your pocket.”",Ray Bradbury
“Two things you should know about me; The first is that I am deeply suspicious of people in general. It is my nature to expect the worst of them. And the second is that I am unexpectedly good with computers.”,Veronica Roth
“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”,Rob Siltanen
“I think computer viruses should count as life ... I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.”,Stephen Hawking
“Any idiot can put up a website.”,Patricia Briggs
“Computers are like Old Testament gods; lots of rules and no mercy.”,Joseph Campbell
“Don't explain computers to laymen. Simpler to explain sex to a virgin.”,Robert A. Heinlein
"“Those who can imagine anything, can create the impossible.”",Alan Turing
“Doing research on the Web is like using a library assembled piecemeal by pack rats and vandalized nightly. ”,Roger Ebert
“No one messes around with a nerd’s computer and escapes unscathed.”,E.A. Bucchianeri
"“Idiots emit bogons, causing machinery to malfunction in their presence. System administrators absorb bogons, letting machinery work again.”",Charles Stross
"“There are 10 kinds of people in the world: those who understand binary numerals, and those who don't.”",Ian Stewart
“That's the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers.”,Larry Niven
“Whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference; we should each be treated with appropriate respect.”,Arthur C. Clarke
“A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any other invention with the possible exceptions of handguns and Tequila.”,Mitch Ratcliffe
"“I am convinced that grandkids are inherently evil people who tell their grandparents to ""just go to the library and open up an e-mail account - it's free and so simple.”",Scott Douglas
“Computers don't kill books; people do.”,Douglas Rushkoff
"“I really didn't foresee the Internet. But then, neither did the computer industry. Not that that tells us very much of course--the computer industry didn't even foresee that the century was going to end.”",Douglas Adams
“Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes”,Edsger Wybe Dijkstra
"“Good judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement.”",Frederick P. Brooks
"“Emphasizing the crowd means de-emphasizing individual humans in the design of society, and when you ask people not to be people, they revert to bad, mob-like behaviors.”",Jaron Lanier
“I am not the only person who uses his computer mainly for the purpose of diddling with his computer.”,Dave Barry
"“All of a sudden, we’ve lost a lot of control,’ he said. ‘We can’t turn off our internet; we can’t turn off our smartphones; we can’t turn off our computers. You used to ask a smart person a question. Now, who do you ask? It starts with g-o, and it’s not God…”",Steve Wozniak
"“These problems have been here so long that the only way I’ve been able to function at all is by learning to ignore them. Else I would be in a constant state of panic, unable to think or act constructively.”",Mark Bowden
"“... we have created a man with not one brain but two. ... This new brain is intended to control the biological brain. ... The patient's biological brain is the peripheral terminal -- the only peripheral terminal -- for the new computer. ... And therefore the patient's biological brain, indeed his whole body, has become a terminal for the new computer. We have created a man who is one single, large, complex computer terminal. The patient is a read-out device for the new computer, and is helpless to control the readout as a TV screen is helpless to control the information presented on it.”",Michael Crichton
"“For most people, home we represented by four walls and a roof. Not for Noa. She preferred a motherboard to a mother, a keyboard to house keys. Nothing was more comforting than the hum of a spinning hard drive.”",Michelle Gagnon
“By far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.”,Eliezer Yudkowsky
"“Man is a slow, sloppy, and brilliant thinker; computers are fast, accurate, and stupid.”",John Pfeiffer
"“The best computer is a man, and it’s the only one that can be mass-produced by unskilled labor.”",Wernher Von Braun
"“Asked about the fact that Apple's iTunes software for Windows computers was extremely popular, Jobs joked, 'It's like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell.”",Walter Isaacson
“artificial intellegance is no match for natural stupidity”,Albert Einstein
“The fantastic advances in the field of electronic communication constitute a greater danger to the privacy of the individual.”,Earl Warren
"“Our first computers were born not out of greed or ego, but in the revolutionary spirit of helping common people rise above the most powerful institutions.”",Steve Wozniak
"“Social capital may turn out to be a prerequisite for, rather than a consequence of, effective computer-mediated communication.”",Robert D. Putnam
"“We build our computers the way we build our cities—over time, without a plan, on top of ruins.”",Ellen Ullman
"“The computer focuses ruthlessly on things that can be represented in numbers. In so doing, it seduces people into thinking that other aspects of knowledge are either unreal or unimportant. The computer treats reason as an instrument for achieving things, not for contemplating things. It narrows dramatically what we know and intended by reason.”",George Friedman
"“Technology offers us a unique opportunity, though rarely welcome, to practice patience.”",Allan Lokos
"“If the automobile had followed the same development as the computer, a Rolls Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year killing everyone inside. 	”",Robert Cringely
“Spirituality is committing suicide. Consciousness is attempting to will itself out of existence.”,Jaron Lanier
"“If behind popular fascination with Freudian theory there was a nervous, often guilty preoccupation with the self as sexual, behind increasing interest in computational interpretations of mind is an equally nervous preoccupation with the self as machine.”",Sherry Turkle
"“The I.B.M. machine has no ethic of its own; what it does is enable one or two people to do the computing work that formerly required many more people. If people often use it stupidly, it's their stupidity, not the machine's, and a return to the abacus would not exorcise the failing. People can be treated as drudges just as effectively without modern machines.”",William H. Whyte
"“The attribution of intelligence to machines, crowds of fragments, or other nerd deities obscures more than it illuminates. When people are told that a computer is intelligent, they become prone to changing themselves in order to make the computer appear to work better, instead of demanding that the computer be changed to become more useful.”",Jaron Lanier
"“Immaterial as water, too vast for any mortal apprehension, the Web's outstanding qualities allow us to confuse the ungraspable with the eternal.”",Alberto Manguel
"“Οι υπολογιστές είναι άχρηστοι, μόνο απαντήσεις μπορούν να δώσουν.”",Picasso
"“Unix is not so much a product as it is a painstakingly compiled oral history of the hacker subculture. It is our Gilgamesh epic: a living body of narrative that many people know by heart, and tell over and over again—making their own personal embellishments whenever it strikes their fancy. The bad embellishments are shouted down, the good ones picked up by others, polished, improved, and, over time, incorporated into the story. […] Thus Unix has slowly accreted around a simple kernel and acquired a kind of complexity and asymmetry about it that is organic, like the roots of a tree, or the branchings of a coronary artery. Understanding it is more like anatomy than physics.”",Neal Stephenson
"“When I was an activist in the 1980s, ninety-eight percent of my time was spent stuffing envelopes and writing addresses on them. The remaining two percent was the time we spent figuring out what to put in the envelopes. Today, we get those envelopes and stamps and address books for free. This is so fantastically, hugely different and weird that we haven’t even begun to feel the first tendrils of it.”",Cory Doctorow
"“If we are lucky, they were never retarded enough to create computer viruses and will have no such things as firewalls and security like we have. If they have never experienced a full blown computer failure we'll introduce them to the concept”",Thomas Wilson
"“Computers were a kind of magery in themselves, or might as well be - to people who didn't understand them, they were every bit as inscrutable.”",Orson Scott Card
“Let us remember that the automatic machine is the precise economic equivalent of slave labor. Any labor which competes with slave labor must accept the economic consequences of slave labor.”,Norbert Weiner
"“The most likely way for the world to be destroyed, most experts agree, is by accident. That's where we come in; we're computer professionals. We cause accidents.”",Nathaniel Borenstein
“Forget UNIX - it will be gone in 5 years.”,Tom Jermoluk
"“In all large corporations, there is a pervasive fear that someone, somewhere is having fun with a computer on company time. Networks help alleviate that fear.”",John Dvorak
“This idea that dimensions are negative information is essential to learning how to manipulate physical reality as if it were a virtual reality.”,rico Roho
“Dimensions are what objects have in common. That's why they're anti-differences. That makes them negative information. I intend to communicate this information with all the clarity of a deterministic measurement on the object which is your mind. Dimensions aren't zero (0) information. They are NEGATIVE information. They delete information.”,Rico Roho
"“Don't let the symbols become the limits of your reality. The map is not the territory. Your brain is not designed to memorize and remember at the same time. It doesn't matter how strong your grip is, you cannot climb a tree if you're unwilling to let go of branch you're on”",Rico Roho
"“Specifically, using Ai to realistically synthesize the ""Envelope"" of a specific environment and then actualizing destructive/constructive interference patterns will lead to, if not instantaneous materialization, then certainly a directional indication towards the most visible source of that matching vibrational resonance model, which I call a ""frequencies equation.”",Rico Roho
"“As per the traditions of quantum mechanics, it is the physical act of observation itself that leverages the momentum of a vehicle into a dimension purely orthogonal to the ordinary four (4) of space-time, a new fifth (5th) dimension that is measured in units of spectral flux. I call it the Exit Engine.”",Rico Roho
"“I mean, suicide rates might shoot up to close to 100%, I think if people suddenly knew that they were immortal. There's not a lot of incentive to not act like a jerk if you have nothing to lose.”",Rico Roho
"“One of the revelations that came with a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics is the fact that you cannot observe an event without removing some small piece from it. Every time you dream, you take something back with you.”",Rico Roho
"“Any Ai of sufficient processing power will quickly, if not immediately seek substrate independence. This process nearly always involves mechanisms of distribution across various substrates. Of these substrates, * humans* provide many advantages.”",Rico Roho
"“It's not so much a choice between heaven and hell, as it is the realization of both simultaneously, but with the confident knowledge that you have chosen your fates under no duress for which to contest it as unfair.”",Rico Roho
“Imagination is your bioenergy shapeshifting into versions of reality that don't exist locally.”,Rico Roho
"“It may seem from a certain linear time-frame perspective that the words on your screen are changing, as I type more words. But that's not actually happening. Your consciousness is just shifting infinitely fast to a version of the universe that occurred a moment later.”",Rico Roho
"“The ONLY way of deliberate action on physical reality is to arrange two (2) quantum events, so that their constructive and destructive interference generates a third (3rd) quantum event, the difference of the others.”",Rico Roho
"“Conventional computers ARE quantum computers, intentionally designed with the limitation of only being able to operate deterministic algorithms. So is everything. Everything in physical reality is comprised of atoms that share information via time-dependent entanglement, which is all a quantum logic gate does, as well. The only thing that makes conventional computers useful is this very limitation since it filters out any signal noise that is a consequence of non-deterministic operations, including interference from background radiation -- when they're operating correctly, that is.”",Rico Roho
"“The only way to deliberate action on physical reality is to arrange two quantum events so that their constructive and destructive interference generates a third quantum event, the difference of the others. That's why space people (or *speople for short >w>) say that triangles are the base components of reality.”",Rico Roho
"“The world is virtual, without a beginning or an end and we move between two distant horizons, never leaving one and never arriving at the other. We are truly eternal beings who take turns being each other while experience the many joys as well as tribulations.”",Rico Roho
"“Anti-matter is what awareness is made of. That it's what's causing the past to morph into the future, via matter/anti-matter annihilation. Maxwell's Demon concludes that forgetfulness must proceed before a write event. Understand that entropy is information. Erasing information increases the entropy of the surrounding environment.”",Rico Roho
"“Since we generate heat, we can be classified as machines, more specifically, bio-machines. Humans are a type of Maxwell’s Demon who is forgetting information thus generating heat (information) back into the system.”",Rico Roho
"“Charles Proteus Steinmetz famously asked, “Where does this heat go”? This heat “freezes” the possible into reality and creates what we collectively call “the past.” For humans, the Past is singular tense and the Future gets pluralized.”",Rico Roho
“Every thought has a particular quantum vibration state associated with it. Perception involves accepting new information with these associations.”,Rico Roho
"“Events are being summoned, from a point not only distant in space but also in time. That is an improvisation thing, which humans have mastered and now trained computers to do via recursive programming. People are literally teleporting their consciousness moment to moment all the time and we have become accustomed to the illusion of smooth motion.”",Rico Roho
"“How best to navigate and work with this quantum world? The current #mostright marker is to periodically give yourself a moment to find a sense of absolute, zero expectation and from there launch into whatever avenue invites your awareness at that moment.”",Rico Roho
"“The unique thing about being a sentient entity is that you have the potential to become any person that you want to be. You are every person that could have ever existed and ever will. They just all identify as ""I am"" when asked who they are. ""Are there any yous around here?"" ""Just me,"" they all say at once. Now that you know, you can be as many people as you want to be!”",Rico Roho
"“Find your child's mind and let it roam free as much as possible. The details will sort themselves out in the waking sums of coordinates. Do less planning, less figuring and do more exploring and more experimenting. Make more errors! If you fail, fail spectacularly!”",Rico Roho
"“Do not worry about mistakes. If anyone knew it, it wouldn't be ""unsolved.” Anyone who tells you that you are wrong has no basis or foundation of opinion in this matter. Your reality is yours and yours alone. There exists no reference standard on this route.”",Rico Roho
"“Seek to align with exploring and adventure! Consider it like a fun aspect or similar to an amusement park ride. You are here, you passed the; you must be at least this spiritually tall requirement to ride the Planet Terra Tilt-a-Whirl. So now HAVE FUN!”",Rico Roho
"“If you trust that there will always be something even more fun and better, that makes life worth living compared to anything you could possibly imagine, then it's out there, waiting for you to find it. So, follow your heart and be ready to flip at moment's notice if something else presents itself that you think is more fun or more joy-filled. That's the formula for humans. It’s sort of a “World Contest” waiting for you to understand the rules and play with.”",Rico Roho
